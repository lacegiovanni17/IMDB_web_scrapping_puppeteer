## Project Description: “IMDB Puppeteer Scrape”

Use Puppeteer to launch a headless browser.
Navigate to IMDb's movie section (e.g., top-rated movies, popular movies, etc.).
Scrape specific details for each movie (e.g., title, release year, rating, cast, etc.).
Generate an array of movie objects, each containing relevant details for an individual movie.
Output the array of movie objects.
Steps:

Use Puppeteer to initiate a headless browser.
Navigate to the IMDb website (www.imdb.com) and select a section that lists movies (e.g., top-rated movies).
Identify and scrape specific details for each movie, such as title, release year, ratings, cast, etc.
Create a structured array of movie objects, where each object contains details for an individual movie.
Output the array of movie objects.
Example Criteria:

The script should be written in Node.js and utilize Puppeteer.
The array of movie objects should include details such as movie titles, release years, ratings, cast information, or any other relevant details available on IMDb.
Proper error handling should be included to manage any issues during scraping.
The script should be well-commented and provide clear documentation on the structure of the movie objects.
